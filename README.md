# Calculator
This is my first project in Python. I chose to replicate the graphical Windows calculator as my project. Data input can be done using both the buttons and the keyboard. The standard operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are available, as well as input of floating-point numbers, changing the sign of a number, and three types of data clearing.
